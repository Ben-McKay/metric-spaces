Take a set consisting of 4 points \(X=\set{a,b_0,b_1,c}\).
Set \(d(a,c)=2)\), and all other distances between distinct points set to \(1\).
Then \(d(a,b_i)+d(b_i,c)=d(a,c)\).
So if \(X\) arises as a subspace of \(\R{n}\), then \(b_0\) and \(b_1\) both bisect the line segment \(ac\), so must be equal, so \(X\) has only three points, a contradiction.
This same example applies in any Hilbert space instead of \(\R{n}\).

Any infinite set with standard discrete metric: balls of radius 2 are not compact, because the open cover by balls of radius \(1/2\) has no finite subcover, so not all balls are compact.
But the closed balls of radius \(1/2\) are compact, each being just a single point.

Immediate from \(r(y) + d(x,y) \ge r(x)\): if \(r(x)\) is infinite then so is \(r(y)\).
\vspace \smallskipamount \newparagraph \noindent \textbf {\ref{problem:metric.spaces:radius.cpt.2}.}
In problem~\vref{problem:metric.spaces:radius.cpt} we saw that \(r(y)+d(x,y) \ge r(x)\), and by symmetry \(r(x)+d(x,y) \ge r(y)\).
Therefore \(d(x,y) \ge |r(x)-r(y)|\), so that if we make \(y \to x\), we find \(r(y) \to r(x)\).
\vspace \smallskipamount \newparagraph \noindent \textbf {\ref{problem:metric.spaces:radius.cpt.4}.}
If the compactness radius is somewhere infinite, the space is proper, so its balls of positive integer radius are compact, and it is the union of these.
So assume that the compactness radius is everywhere finite.
By local compactness, the compactness radius is everywhere positive and \(d(x,y)\ge|r(x)-r(y)|\), so the compactness radius is continuous.
Taking any compact set \(K \subset X\), let \(K'\) be the union of all closed balls of radius \(r(x)/2\) about points \(x \in K\).
Any infinite sequence \(x_1,x_2,\dots \in K'\) has each \(x_i\) at distance at most \(r(y_i)/2\) from some \(y_i \in K\).
Take a convergent subsequence of \(y_1,y_2,\dots\), and replace the original sequence with the subsequence, so \(y_1,y_2,\dots \to y\) say.
Then \(d(x_i,y_i)\le r(y_i)/2 \to r(y)/2\).
Far enough down the sequence \(x_1,x_2,\dots\), every \(x_i\) lies in the compact ball of radius \(3r(y)/2\) about \(y\).
Thus \(x_1,x_2,\dots\) has a convergent subsequence.

Given two maps \(f, g \colon S^1 \to S^1\) of the circle, with equal degree, let \(f_t=F_t f\) and \(g_t=F_t g\).
Then
\[
\hat{f}_t(\theta)-\hat{g}_t(\theta) = (1-t)\pr{\hat{f}(\theta)-\hat{g}(\theta)}
+\frac{t}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \hat{f}-\hat{g}.
\]
Therefore
\[
d\pr{f_t,g_t}
\le
(1-t)d\pr{f,g}.

Differentiate:
\[
\pd{}{t}f_t(x)=X(f_t(x)),
\]
and applied to \(t=t_1+t_2\),
\[
\pd{}{t_2}f_{t_1+t_2}(x)=X(f_{t_1+t_2}(x)),
\]
and replacing \(x\) by \(f_{t_1}(x)\),
\[
\pd{}{t_2}f_{t_2}(f_{t_1}(x))=X(f_{t_1}(f_{t_2}(x))).
\]
So for any fixed \(t_1\), \(f_{t_2}(f_{t_1}(x))\) is a flow line of \(X\) through \(f_{t_1}(x)\), but so is \(f_{t_1+t_2}(x)\), and both start, when \(t_2=0\), at the point \(f_{t_1}(x)\).
By uniqueness of the flow (theorem~\vref{theorem:Picard.Lipschitz}), they are equal: \(f_{t_1+t_2}(x)=f_{t_1+t_2}(x)\).

A flow in our sense above, given by flow lines, is also a flow in the sense of Picard's theorem.
But suppose that there are two flows in the sense of Picard's theorem, say \(F(t,x)\) and \(G(t,x)\).
Note that \(G_0(x)=x\).
Consider the map \(H(t,x)\defeq G(-t,F(t,x))\).
We need to prove that \(H(t,x)=x\) for all \(t,x\).
Differentiate:
\[
\pd{}{t}H(t,x)
=-\pd{G}{t}(-t,F(t,x))+\pd{G}{x}(-t,F(t,x))\pd{F}{t}(t,x),
\]
and plug in \(t=0\) to get
\[
\left.\pd{}{t}\right|_{t=0}H(t,x)=-X(x)+X(x)=0.
\]
So \(H(t,x)=x+O(t)^2\).
Let \(H_t(x)\defeq H(t,x)\).
For any integer \(N\ge 1\):
\[
H_t(x)=H_{t/N}^{\circ N}(x)=x+O(t/N)^2+\dots+O(t/N)^2=x+\frac{O(t)^2}{N} \to x
\]
as \(N \to \infty\), but the left hand side is independent of \(N\).

Take the graph of a continuous function \(y=f(x)\) which is not rectifiable.
\vspace \smallskipamount \newparagraph \noindent \textbf {\ref{problem:metric.space.maps:covering.completeness}.}
Suppose that \(Y\) is complete.
Take a Cauchy sequence \(x_1,x_2,\dots\) in \(X\).
Let \(y_i\coloneqq f(x_i)\).
Because \(f\) is a local isometry, applied to nearby points, \(f\) preserves lengths of paths, so preserves distances.
So \(y_1, y_2, \dots\) is a Cauchy sequence, so converges, say to some \(y \in Y\).
Pick an evenly covered open set \(U_y \subset Y\) around \(y\).
Take the point \(x_a\) inside each open set \(U_a \subset X\) covering \(U\).
The set \(U_y\) contains a ball, say of radius \(r\), around \(y\).
The preimage of this ball inside each set \(U_a\) contains a ball \(B_a\) of radius \(r\) around \(x_a\).
Let \(B'_a \subset B_a\) be the ball of half the radius.
The points \(y_i=f(x_i)\) converge to \(y\), so the points \(x_i\) must get close to some choice of point \(x_a\) for large \(i\).
If infinitely many of the points \(x_i\) lie inside different balls \(B'_a\), then those infinitely many points are all of distance at least \(r/2\) apart, not in a Cauchy sequence.
So all but finitely many of the points \(x_i\) lie inside the same ball \(B'_a\).
The map \(f\) restricts to that ball to identify it with a ball around \(y\), and \(y_i=f(x_i) \to y\) so \(x_i=f^{-1}_a(y_i) \to x=f^{-1}(y)\).

Suppose that \(X\) is complete.
Take a Cauchy sequence \(y_1, y_2, \dots\) on \(Y\).
Pick some numbers \(\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2, \dots \ge 0\) with \(\varepsilon_1 + \varepsilon_2 + \dots\) finite.
Pick some \(i_1\) so that, for any \(j,k > i_1\), \(d(y_j,y_k)<\varepsilon_1\), and similarly \(i_2\) and so on.
Replace the sequence \(y_1, y_2, \dots\) with \(y_{i_1}, y_{i_2}, \dots\).
We need only prove that this sequence converges.
Take a sequence of paths from \(y_i\) to \(y_{i+1}\), of lengths shrinking to zero, so that the lengths have finite sum.
Lift each of these paths up to paths in \(X\), starting from some point \(x_1\) that maps to \(y_1\), and successively lifting paths.
Join these paths together into one path \(y(t)\), and lift it to \(M\), i.e. to a path \(x(t)\) so that \(f(x(t))=y(t)\).
Then there are various times \(t_i\) at which \(y(t_i)=y_i\).
Let \(x_i \coloneqq x(t_i)\).
Since the length of \(x(t)\) between \(t_i\) and \(t_{i+1}\) is the same as the length of \(y(t)\) between those times, the points \(x_i\) and \(x_{j+1}\) are of distance at most \(\varepsilon_i+\dots+\varepsilon_j\) apart.
So \(x_1, x_2, \dots\) is a Cauchy sequence, converging to some point \(x \in M\).
Let \(y=f(x)\) and then \(y_i \to y\).

Let \(Y\) be any connected metric space containing more than one point.
Let \(X\) be \(Y\) as a set of points, but with the standard discrete metric.
Let \(f \colon X \to Y\) be the obvious map \(f(x)=x\) for all \(x \in X=Y\).
For each point \(x \in X\), no open set around \(x \in Y\) maps under \(f^{-1}\) into the open set \(\set{x}\) around \(x\).
So \(f^{-1}\) is nowhere continuous.
